### Overview
This project is a **text-based adventure game** developed in **Python**.  
Players explore mysterious locations, make choices, and aim to discover a hidden treasure.  

The project reinforces Python fundamentals, including:
- Variables and data types  
- Conditional statements  
- Loops and user input  
- Functions and modular code design  

---

### Objective
To design and implement an **interactive command-line adventure game** that encourages logical thinking and demonstrates the use of control structures and user-driven decision making.

---

### Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **AI Assistant:** GitHub Copilot  

---

### How AI (GitHub Copilot) Was Used
GitHub Copilot, powered by **OpenAI Codex**, was used as an **AI pair programmer** throughout the development process. It assisted in:
- **Code Generation:** Suggesting complete function bodies (e.g., `start_game()`, `forest_path()`, `cave_path()`), saving time in writing repetitive structures.  
- **Logic Optimization:** Proposing simplified conditional statements and improving code readability.  
- **Error Reduction:** Offering syntax corrections and best practices in Python.  
- **Idea Expansion:** Generating alternate ways to present story paths and decision outcomes.  

By leveraging Copilot’s AI capabilities, the development process became faster and more efficient, allowing focus on creative game design instead of repetitive coding.

### Game Flow
1. The game begins by introducing the quest and asking for the player’s name.  
2. The player chooses between exploring a **dark forest** or entering a **mysterious cave**.  
3. Each path includes multiple decisions affecting the story’s outcome.  
4. The game ends with one of three outcomes:  
   - **Win:** Find the treasure.  
   - **Lose:** Make a wrong choice.  
   - **Restart:** Replay the game after failure.  

---

### Key Functions
- `start_game()` – Introduces the game and captures player input.  
- `forest_path()` – Handles events and outcomes in the forest path.  
- `cave_path()` – Manages decisions and outcomes in the cave path.  

---

### Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened understanding of core Python concepts and logical structures.  
- Gained experience in **AI-assisted programming** using GitHub Copilot.  
- Learned to integrate storytelling with functional programming logic.
